# WiFi Disconnect :D
Linux terminal app which is used to disconnect selected device from your network with main goal to get better ping, under 200ms
Airmon-ng is required, you must have wifi card which supports monitor mode, and you have to put it into the monitor mode manually

Usage: prog.py [bssid] [dmac] [interface]

dmac --> mac address of device you want disconnect


That's my first published app xD
